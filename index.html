        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>A black panther is the melanistic colour variant of any Panthera, particularly of the leopard in Asia and
            Africa, and the jaguar in the Americas.</p>

        <h2>Melanism in the genus Panthera</h2>
        <p>Melanism in the jaguar is conferred by a dominant allele, and in the leopard by a recessive allele.
            Melanistic and non-melanistic animals can be littermates. It is thought that melanism confers a
            selective
            advantage under certain conditions since it is more common in regions of dense forest, where light
            levels
            are lower. Preliminary studies also suggest that melanism might be linked to beneficial mutations in the
            immune system. Due to the excess black pigments, the typical spotted markings are present, but hidden,
            which is called "ghost rosettes"</p>

        <h3>Facts</h3>
        <p>The animal known as a "panther" actually refers to 3 different types of big cats, leopards (Panthera
            pardus) or jaguars (Panthera onca) that have a black or white color mutation and a subspecies of the
            cougar</p>
        <p>Melanism is the name of the dark color pigmentation mutation in a jaguar or leopard that cause the fur to
            be blackish, it occurs in about 6% of the population.</p>
        <p>The opposite of melanism is albinism which is an even rarer mutation that can occur in most animal
            species. The extremely rare "white panther" are albino leopards, jaguars or cougars.</p>
        <p>Because the melanism gene is a dominant gene in jaguars, a black jaguar may produce either black or
            spotted cubs, while a pair of spotted jaguars can only have spotted cubs.</p>
        <p>Black panthers are great swimmers and are one of the strongest tree climbing big cats, often pouncing on
            prey from a tree, they are capable of leaping up to 20 feet to catch their prey which includes medium
            sized animals like deer and monkeys and smaller rabbits and birds.</p>

            <h4>Habitant</h4>
            <p>Black panthers live chiefly in the hot, dense tropical rainforests of South and Southeast Asia. They
                are
                mainly in Southwestern China, Burma, Nepal, Southern India, Indonesia, and the southern part of
                Malaysia. Black leopards are more common than light-colored leopards.</p>
